# ProjectR_X_0.1
Rezonator based NN(ReBNN) is a new architecture which learn the system behaviour in frequency domain and use classical passive structures to gurantee stability of learned Neural network. 

  
Goal : The aim of the project is to demonstarte the capabilities of ReBNN in comparision to classical NN based system. The comparison results can be written in context of 

1. Size of network 
2. computational expense
3. Time to learn
4. Robustness to different signal
5. Robustness in context of Generalisation (validation & test errors => in context of trained signal)
6. Amount of data required to train. 
7. sensitivity to noise 
8. Contiunity of dynamic(Lipschitz)
9. Incremental training effect( will it overfit?)
10. Benefits of orthogonalised vs non-orthogonalised space exploration.

Dynamics in study : Ogata - car suspension model
