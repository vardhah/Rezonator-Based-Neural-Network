# ProjectR_X_0.1
scalable experiment of RBNN
  
Goal : The aim of the project is to demonstarte the capabilities of RBNN in comparision to classical NN based system. The comparison results can be written in context of 

1. Size of network 
1'. computational expense
2. Time to learn
3. Robustness to different signal
4. Robustness in context of Generalisation (validation & test errors => in context of trained signal)
4'. Amount of data required to train. 
5. sensitivity to noise 
6. Contiunity of dynamic(Lipschitz)
7. Incremental training effect( will it overfit?)
8. Benefits of orthogonalised vs non-orthogonalised space exploration.
